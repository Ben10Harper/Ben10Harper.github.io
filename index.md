## Welcome to my site! :cowboy_hat_face:
It's *very* bare right now, but I will be adding more with time! :smile:
A little about me, is that I **LOVE** music and skateboarding, that's mostly what I do in my freetime
besides homework, hanging out with friends, playing games, or riding my bike around.
